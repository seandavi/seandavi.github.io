 abstract = {Bioconductor's SummarizedExperiment class unites numerical assay
quantifications with sample- and experiment-level metadata.
SummarizedExperiment is the standard Bioconductor class for
assays that produce matrix-like data, used by over 200 packages.
We describe the restfulSE package, a deployment of this data
model that supports remote storage. We illustrate use of
SummarizedExperiment with remote HDF5 and Google BigQuery back
ends, with two applications in cancer genomics. Our intent is to
allow the use of familiar and semantically meaningful
programmatic idioms to query genomic data, while abstracting the
remote interface from end users and developers.},
