      <description>I use emacs for nearly all my editing and interactive analysis. As one typically does, more than one project is the norm, not the exception. Discovering projectile for project-specific buffers and controls, combined with helm for very fast, fuzzy completions, makes emacs a very convenient and efficient environment for most task.
