      <description>I use emacs for nearly all my editing and interactive analysis. As one typically does, more than one project is the norm, not the exception. Discovering projectile for project-specific buffers and controls, combined with helm for very fast, fuzzy completions, makes emacs a very convenient and efficient environment for most task.
One challenge I ran into was the need to have multiple interactive python buffers, typically one per project. However, the out-of-the-box behavior of python-mode is to have only one python interactive buffer named &amp;ldquo;Python&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I made a mistake and am going to share it here. Please be gentle when judging me. As penance, I spent some time to learn how to systematically avoid making the same mistake and share that solution here.
The prelude I had been working on some code that I thought was going to be throw-away example code for loading a large dataset into ElasticSearch. That said, I have been saved often enough by using a version control system (now, always git), that I use it all the time.</description>
