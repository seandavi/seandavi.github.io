 abstract = {This volume expands on statistical analysis of
genomic data by discussing cross-cutting groundwork
material, public data repositories, common
applications, and representative tools for operating
on genomic data. Statistical Genomics: Methods and
Protocols is divided into four sections. The first
section discusses overview material and resources
that can be applied across topics mentioned
throughout the book. The second section covers
prominent public repositories for genomic data. The
third section presents several different biological
applications of statistical genomics, and the fourth
section highlights software tools that can be used
to facilitate ad hoc analysis and data
integration. Written in the highly successful
Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters
include introductions to their respective topics,
step-by-step, readily reproducible analysis
protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding
known pitfalls. Thorough and practical, **Statistical
Genomics: Methods and Protocols**, explores a range of
both applications and tools and is ideal for anyone
interested in the statistical analysis of genomic
data.},
