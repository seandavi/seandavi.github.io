 abstract = {Our analysis of GAW10 problem 2 data set consisted of linear regression analysis followed by linkage analysis. The linear regression analysis allowed some exploration of the relationships between the quantitative variables. Furthermore, it isolated some of the components of certain quantitative variables that were not due to a major locus and facilitated the linkage analysis that followed. For the linkage analysis, we used MAPMAKER/SIBS and the SIBPAL program from S.A.G.E. We found linkage of Q4 to chromosome 8. Analysis using the residuals of Q1 and Q3 showed linkage to chromosomes 5 and 4, respectively.},
