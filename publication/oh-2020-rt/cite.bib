 abstract = {Gene symbols are recognizable identifiers for gene names but are
unstable and error-prone due to aliasing, manual entry, and
unintentional conversion by spreadsheets to date format.
Official gene symbol resources such as HUGO Gene Nomenclature
Committee (HGNC) for human genes and the Mouse Genome
Informatics project (MGI) for mouse genes provide authoritative
sources of valid, aliased, and outdated symbols, but lack a
programmatic interface and correction of symbols converted by
spreadsheets. We present HGNChelper, an R package that
identifies known aliases and outdated gene symbols based on the
HGNC human and MGI mouse gene symbol databases, in addition to
common mislabeling introduced by spreadsheets, and provides
corrections where possible. HGNChelper identified invalid gene
symbols in the most recent Molecular Signatures Database (mSigDB
7.0) and in platform annotation files of the Gene Expression
Omnibus, with prevalence ranging from ~3% in recent platforms
to 30-40% in the earliest platforms from 2002-03. HGNChelper is
installable from CRAN.},
