 abstract = {We have analyzed the GAW10 data from several studies of bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) using the software packages SimIBD and SIMWALK2. SimIBD implements a simulation-based affected-pedigree-member (APM) statistic, called SimAPM, as well as an APM-like statistic, also called SimIBD, that measures identical-by-descent (IBD) sharing. SIMWALK2 uses Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to compute several IBD-based statistics on the degree of marker-allele clustering among all affected relatives. We have found no strong evidence of linkage to either chromosome 5 or 18. However, we did find that several markers showed p-values less than 0.01 and may deserve further study.},
