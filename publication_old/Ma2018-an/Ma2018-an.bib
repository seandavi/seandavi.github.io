 abstract = {Analysis of molecular aberrations across multiple cancer types,
known as pan-cancer analysis, identifies commonalities and
differences in key biological processes that are dysregulated in
cancer cells from diverse lineages. Pan-cancer analyses have been
performed for adult but not paediatric cancers, which commonly
occur in developing mesodermic rather than adult epithelial
tissues. Here we present a pan-cancer study of somatic
alterations, including single nucleotide variants, small
insertions or deletions, structural variations, copy number
alterations, gene fusions and internal tandem duplications in
1,699 paediatric leukaemias and solid tumours across six
histotypes, with whole-genome, whole-exome and transcriptome
sequencing data processed under a uniform analytical framework.
We report 142 driver genes in paediatric cancers, of which only
45% match those found in adult pan-cancer studies; copy number
alterations and structural variants constituted the majority
(62%) of events. Eleven genome-wide mutational signatures were
identified, including one attributed to ultraviolet-light
exposure in eight aneuploid leukaemias. Transcription of the
mutant allele was detectable for 34% of protein-coding
mutations, and 20% exhibited allele-specific expression. These
data provide a comprehensive genomic architecture for paediatric
cancers and emphasize the need for paediatric cancer-specific
development of precision therapies.},
