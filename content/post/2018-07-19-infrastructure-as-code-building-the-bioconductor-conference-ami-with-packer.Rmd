One of the main features of the annual [Bioconductor Conference] is the 
proportion of time spent working with code in the form of [workshops].
To support these workshops, we ask workshop presenters to supply [Rmarkdown]
materials which we collate into workshop materials. Using literate programming
approaches like Rmarkdown ensures that the workflows are self-consistent 
and work as expected. 

In addition to the Rmarkdown workshop materials, we also need a consistent 
computing environment that can support reasonably large computation, provide
high-performance network and file system access, and is essentially unlimited
in scale (we expect to have >150 participants, each with his/her own machine).
To do so, we use [Amazon Web Services EC2]. The EC2 system allows us to prepare
a [Amazon machine "image"], or AMI, that contains the operating system, libraries,
the newest version of R, and all packages needed for the workshops. In the past,
creating the "image" was a manual process. This year, thanks to the work
of the workshop organizers, we had a single DESCRIPTION file that contained
all the necessary packages, allowing us to automate the process of building
and keeping updated the AMI that would be used by all participants.

The [Packer project] is an open source tool for creating identical
machine images for multiple platforms from a single source
configuration. Packer is lightweight, runs on every major operating
system, and is highly performant, creating machine images for multiple
platforms in parallel. In this context, a machine image is a single
static unit that contains a pre-configured operating system and
installed software which is used to quickly create new running
machines. Machine image formats change for each platform. Some
examples include AMIs for EC2, VMDK/VMX files for VMware, OVF exports
for VirtualBox, etc.


Biocoductor is cloud-ready and maintains [basic AMIs for Bioconductor]. Rather
than needing to start with a generic Linux AMI as the "base" for our
Bioconductor conference AMI, I will use
the most recent [Bioc-devel AMI] as the base. Packer uses a [json format file]
to describe, _in code_, the AMI that we want to build. The file for building the image 
is listed below in its entirety. The current version of the packer json file
is available in this [github repo].

To build the image, first [set up AWS authentication] as outlined on the 
packer website. If you do not have an AWS account, you will not be able
to actually build the AMI. Next, [install packer] and ensure that it is in the path. 
Finally, save the file below as, for example, `bioc_2018.json`. In the 
directory containing the json file, execute packer:

```sh
packer build bioc_2018.json
```

This build takes quite some time (perhaps 20 minutes or so). 


In terms of details, briefly, the `instance_type`
below was chosen to allow multicore installation using 16 threads. AWS [spot pricing]
is used to minimize costs (see `spot_pricing` and `spot_pricing_auto_product` below).
Adding the `ami_groups` set to `all` will enable public access to the AMI. The `source_ami_filter` 
section below chooses the "base" image. In this case, I used the AMI `name` and 
specified that the AMI was "owned" by the Bioconductor organization (`"owners": ["555219204010"]`).
I set the disk size to 128GB of SSD storage in the `launch_block_device_mappings`.

The real work is done in the `provisioners` block. In this case, the provisioner
block specifies just two shell commands that install the necessary packages. Note 
that the installation of the "Bioconductor/Biocworkshops" github package will
install all packages in the [DESCRIPTION] file. The final line of the packer
output will list the AMI ID that can be shared with others (since we made it public).
The AMI may take a few minutes to become fully public.

        }
    ],
    "provisioners": [
        {
            "type": "shell",
            "inline":[
                "Rscript -e 'BiocManager::install(\"remotes\")'",
                "Rscript -e 'options(Ncpus=16); BiocManager::install(\"Bioconductor/BiocWorkshops\")'",
            ]
        }
    ]
}
	
```

By maintaining the AMI description as code, we can ensure that the AMI is 
fully reproducible (no manual installations, etc.) and, therefore, highly
reproducible and even reusable.

Waldron, Lori Shepherd, Marcel Ramos, Martin Morgan, and multiple workshop
authors for their contributions.
