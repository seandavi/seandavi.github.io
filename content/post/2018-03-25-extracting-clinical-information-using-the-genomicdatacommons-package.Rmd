This short post introducds the `gdc_clinical()` function recently
added to the GenomicDataCommons package. 

The
[rich data model](https://gdc.cancer.gov/developers/gdc-data-model) at
the NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC) includes clinical and biospecimen
details. A recently added feature to the NCI GDC Data Portal is the
ability to download tab-delimited files or JSON files for clinical and
biospecimen details of samples. The details available in these
simplified formats are also available via the GDC API. 

```{r libraries}
library(GenomicDataCommons)
```

The clinical
infomation at the GDC is encapsulated in the `cases` records. Here, I
introduce the `gdc_clinical()` function from
the
[GenomicDataCommons](https://bioconductor.org/packages/GenomicDataCommons) package that
takes as input
GDC case IDs and returns a set of four related `data.frame`s:

- main: important case metadata
- demographics: basic demographic information
- exposures: zero or more documented exposures
- diagnoses: zero or more diagnoses per case

As an example application, we will examine the clinical details for
100 lung adenocarcinoma patients from TCGA ("TCGA-LUAD"). The case ids
are available through a basic `cases()` query, `filter`ed to include
only samples that belong to the project from `TCGA-LUAD` (stored in
the `project.project_id` field). The query to get these case_ids,
then, looks like:

```{r }
case_ids = cases() %>%
    filter(~ project.project_id == 'TCGA-LUAD') %>%
    results(size=100) %>%
    ids()
head(case_ids)
```

These case_ids, each representing a single case (patient) in the GDC,
can be be fed directly to `gdc_clinical`. 

```{r gdc_clinical}
clin_res = gdc_clinical(case_ids)
```

The result is a list of data.frames:

```{r clin_res}
names(clin_res)
```

The the dimensions of these data.frames is instructive.

```{r clin_res_dims}
sapply(clin_res, dim) %>%
    t() %>%
    data.frame() %>%
    set_names(c('rows','columns'))
```

And the column names for each are helpful to examine:

```{r clin_res_cols}
sapply(clin_res, colnames)
```

Note the each data.frame contains a `case_id` column by design to
allow arbitrary joining of the tables to each other. In this case, the
data relationships are not too complicated, but one might imagine
situations arising that include many-to-many relationships that are
hard to handle in a fully general way without some understanding of
downstream use (what do we want to do with the clinical
information?). In this relatively simple case, we can create a
"master" data.frame by joining all the records from each data.frame.

```{r clin_res_join}
library(dplyr)
full_clin = with(clin_res,
     main %>%
     left_join(demographic, by = "case_id") %>%
     left_join(exposures, by = "case_id") %>%
     left_join(diagnoses, by = "case_id"))
```

Above, I have used the tidyverse approach, applying `dplyr`
`left_join()`s. Using base R `merge` would also work. 

```{r fill_clin_dim}
dim(full_clin)
colnames(full_clin)
```

In conclusion, the `gdc_clinical` functionality from the
GenomicDataCommons is a high-level function for capturing unified and
harmonized clinical information for *any* case in the NCI GDC
repository.
