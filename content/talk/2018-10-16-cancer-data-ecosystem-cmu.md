abstract = "In this talk, I motivate the need for cloud-based cancer data resourdces. I provide an overview of the NCI Genomic Data Commons and how to interact with it both interactively through a web portal as well as programmatically using the GenomicDataCommons Bioconductor package. I highlight some challenges to implementation and adoption."
