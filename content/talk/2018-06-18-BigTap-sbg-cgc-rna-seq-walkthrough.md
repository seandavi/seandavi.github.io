## Introduction

In this guided workshop, we will use the [SevenBridges Cancer Genomics Cloud Resource](https://cgc.sbgenomics.com) to run simple RNA-seq
workflow on cloud resources. Each participant will:

1. Get an account on the platform.
2. Learn to navigate through the features includes with the platform.
3. Load the example date (below) into the platform.
4. Use an existing RNA-seq pipeline to run analysis on the example data.
