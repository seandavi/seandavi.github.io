Progress in biotechnology is continually leading to new types of data,
resulting in data sets that are rapidly increasing in volume,
resolution and diversity. The promise of unprecedented advances in our
understanding of biological systems and in medicine is challenged by
complexity and volume of data also challenge scientists’ ability to
analyze them. Meeting this challenge requires continuous improvements
in analytical methods and capable, usable software tools implementing
them. Bioconductor is a well-established open-source, open-development
software project for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput
data in genomics and molecular biology. The project aims to enable
interdisciplinary research, collaboration and rapid development of
scientific software. Based on the statistical programming language R,
Bioconductor comprises 1473 interoperable packages contributed by a
large, diverse community of scientists. These packages undergo formal
initial review and continuous automated testing. Each package includes
documentation and working example use cases. Bioconductor supports
many types of high-throughput sequencing data (including DNA, RNA,
chromatin immunoprecipitation, Hi-C, methylomes and ribosome
profiling) and associated annotation resources; contains mature
facilities for microarray analysis; and covers proteomic, metabolomic,
flow cytometry, quantitative imaging, cheminformatic and other
high-throughput data. Bioconductor package interoperability enables
the rapid creation of workflows combining and integrating multiple
data types and tools for statistical inference, regression, network
analysis, machine learning and visualization at all stages of a
project from data generation to publication. A large and growing
community of researchers and users contribute to ongoing development,
online support, and education. The influence of the project is
evidenced by more than 250,000 downloads per year and tens of
thousands of citations in the literature. I will present an overview
of the project for prospective users and contributors.
