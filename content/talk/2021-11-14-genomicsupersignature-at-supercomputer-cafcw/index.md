title: "GenomicSuperSignature: Interpretation of RNA-Seq Experiments through Robust, Efficient Comparison to Public Databases"
subtitle: ""
summary: "Millions of transcriptomic profiles have been deposited in public archives, yet remain underused for the interpretation of new experiments. Existing methods for leveraging these public resources have focused on the reanalysis of existing data or analysis of new datasets independently. We present a novel approach to interpreting new transcriptomic datasets by near-instantaneous comparison to public archives without high-performance computing requirements. All necessary data and functions to apply our approach to existing or new data are included in our software available as part of the Bioconductor project."
