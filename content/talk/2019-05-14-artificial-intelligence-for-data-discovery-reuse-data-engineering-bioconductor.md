abstract = "Lightweight tools, software, and publication processes that tie together data resources, analysis tools, documentation can powerful stimuli for the high-quality reuse of available data. While developed with reproducibility as a core value, Bioconductor tooling and infrastructure has reduced barriers to data reuse and established best practices for rich data and metadata sharing in genomics and proteomics. In this talk, I give a few examples and motivation for how the Bioconductor data ecosystem can be a model for other communities to enhance the value of available data."
