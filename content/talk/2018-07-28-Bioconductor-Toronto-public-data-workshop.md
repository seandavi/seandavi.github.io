## Workshop Description

The goal of this workshop is to introduce Bioconductor packages for finding,
accessing, and using large-scale public data resources including the
Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), Sequence
Read Archive [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), the Genomic Data
Commons [GDC](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/), and Bioconductor-hosted
curated data resources for metagenomics, pharmacogenomics [PharmacoDB](http://pharmacodb.ca/), and The Cancer
Genome Atlas.
