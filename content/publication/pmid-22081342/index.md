abstract: New technologies allow for genome-scale measurement of DNA methylation.
  In an effort to increase the clinical utility of DNA methylation as a biomarker,
  we have adapted a commercial bisulfite epigenotyping assay for genome-wide methylation
  profiling in archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pathology specimens. This
  chapter takes the reader step by step through a biomarker discovery experiment to
  identify phenotype-correlated DNA methylation signatures in routine pathology specimens.
