abstract: "We present here four nonparametric statistics for linkage analysis that\
  \ test whether pairs of affected relatives share marker alleles more often than\
  \ expected. These statistics are based on simulating the null distribution of a\
  \ given statistic conditional on the unaffecteds' marker genotypes. Each statistic\
  \ uses a different measure of marker sharing: the SimAPM statistic uses the simulation-based\
  \ affected-pedigree-member measure based on identity-by-state (IBS) sharing. The\
  \ SimKIN (kinship) measure is 1.0 for identity-by-descent (IBD) sharing, 0.0 for\
  \ no IBD status sharing, and the kinship coefficient when the IBD status is ambiguous.\
  \ The simulation-based IBD (SimIBD) statistic uses a recursive algorithm to determine\
  \ the probability of two affecteds sharing a specific allele IBD. The SimISO statistic\
  \ is identical to SimIBD, except that it also measures marker similarity between\
  \ unaffected pairs. We evaluated our statistics on data simulated under different\
  \ two-locus disease models, comparing our results to those obtained with several\
  \ other nonparametric statistics. Use of IBD information produces dramatic increases\
  \ in power over the SimAPM method, which uses only IBS information. The power of\
  \ our best statistic in most cases meets or exceeds the power of the other nonparametric\
  \ statistics. Furthermore, our statistics perform comparisons between all affected\
  \ relative pairs within general pedigrees and are not restricted to sib pairs or\
  \ nuclear families."
