abstract: The incidence of melanoma is increasing more than any other cancer, and
  knowledge of its genetic alterations is limited. To systematically analyze such
  alterations, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 14 matched normal and metastatic
  tumor DNAs. Using stringent criteria, we identified 68 genes that appeared to be
  somatically mutated at elevated frequency, many of which are not known to be genetically
  altered in tumors. Most importantly, we discovered that TRRAP harbored a recurrent
  mutation that clustered in one position (p. Ser722Phe) in 6 out of 167 affected
  individuals (4%), as well as a previously unidentified gene, GRIN2A, which was mutated
  in 33% of melanoma samples. The nature, pattern and functional evaluation of the
  TRRAP recurrent mutation suggest that TRRAP functions as an oncogene. Our study
  provides, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive map of genetic alterations in
  melanoma to date and suggests that the glutamate signaling pathway is involved in
  this disease.
