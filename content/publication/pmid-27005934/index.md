abstract: 'Translational genomics research in cancers, e.g., International Cancer
  Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), has generated large
  multidimensional datasets from high-throughput technologies. Data analysis at multidimensional
  level will greatly benefit clinical applications of genomic information in diagnosis,
  prognosis and therapeutics of cancers. To help, tools to effectively visualize integrated
  multidimensional data are important for understanding and describing the relationship
  between genomic variations and cancers. We implemented the R package, caOmicsV,
  to provide methods under R environment to visualize multidimensional cancer genomic
  data in two layouts: matrix layout and combined biological network and circular
  layout. Both layouts support to display sample information, gene expression (e.g.,
  RNA and miRNA), DNA methylation, DNA copy number variations, and summarized data.
  A set of supplemental functions are included in the caOmicsV package to help users
  in generation of plot data sets from multiple genomic datasets with given gene names
  and sample names. Default plot methods for both layouts for easy use are also implemented.
  caOmicsV package provides an easy and flexible way to visualize integrated multidimensional
  cancer genomic data under R environment.'
