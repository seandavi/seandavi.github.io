abstract: Sarcomas are a biologically complex group of tumors of mesenchymal origin.
  By using gene expression microarray analysis, we aimed to find clues into the cellular
  differentiation and oncogenic pathways active in these tumors as well as potential
  biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We examined 181 tumors representing 16 classes
  of human bone and soft tissue sarcomas on a 12,601-feature cDNA microarray. Remarkably,
  2,766 probes differentially expressed across this sample set clearly delineated
  the various tumor classes. Several genes of potential biological and therapeutic
  interest were associated with each sarcoma type, including specific tyrosine kinases,
  transcription factors, and homeobox genes. We also identified subgroups of tumors
  within the liposarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, and malignant fibrous histiocytomas. We
  found significant gene ontology correlates for each tumor group and identified similarity
  to normal tissues by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Mutation analysis done on 275
  tumor samples revealed that the high expression of epidermal growth factor receptor
  (EGFR) in certain tumors was not associated with gene mutations. Finally, to further
  the investigation of human sarcoma biology, we have created an online, publicly
  available, searchable database housing the data from the gene expression profiles
  of these tumors (http://watson.nhgri.nih.gov/sarcoma), allowing the user to interactively
  explore this data set in depth.
