abstract: Cutaneous malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive and frequently chemoresistant
  cancer, the incidence of which continues to rise. Epidemiological studies show that
  the major aetiological melanoma risk factor is ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation,
  with the highest risk associated with intermittent burning doses, especially during
  childhood. We have experimentally validated these epidemiological findings using
  the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor transgenic mouse model, which develops
  lesions in stages highly reminiscent of human melanoma with respect to biological,
  genetic and aetiological criteria, but only when irradiated as neonatal pups with
  UVB, not UVA. However, the mechanisms underlying UVB-initiated, neonatal-specific
  melanomagenesis remain largely unknown. Here we introduce a mouse model permitting
  fluorescence-aided melanocyte imaging and isolation following in vivo UV irradiation.
  We use expression profiling to show that activated neonatal skin melanocytes isolated
  following a melanomagenic UVB dose bear a distinct, persistent interferon response
  signature, including genes associated with immunoevasion. UVB-induced melanocyte
  activation, characterized by aberrant growth and migration, was abolished by antibody-mediated
  systemic blockade of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), but not type-I interferons. IFN-γ was
  produced by macrophages recruited to neonatal skin by UVB-induced ligands to the
  chemokine receptor Ccr2. Admixed recruited skin macrophages enhanced transplanted
  melanoma growth by inhibiting apoptosis; notably, IFN-γ blockade abolished macrophage-enhanced
  melanoma growth and survival. IFN-Î³-producing macrophages were also identified
  in 70% of human melanomas examined. Our data reveal an unanticipated role for IFN-γ
  in promoting melanocytic cell survival/immunoevasion, identifying a novel candidate
  therapeutic target for a subset of melanoma patients.
