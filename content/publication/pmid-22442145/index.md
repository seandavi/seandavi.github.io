abstract: Thyroid hormone (T(3)) acts in chondrocytes and bone-forming osteoblasts
  to control bone development and maintenance, but the signaling pathways mediating
  these effects are poorly understood. Thrb(PV/PV) mice have a severely impaired pituitary-thyroid
  axis and elevated thyroid hormone levels due to a dominant-negative mutant T(3)
  receptor (TRÎ²(PV)) that cannot bind T(3) and interferes with the actions of wild-type
  TR. Thrb(PV/PV) mice have accelerated skeletal development due to unknown mechanisms.
  We performed microarray studies in primary osteoblasts from wild-type mice and Thrb(PV/PV)
  mice. Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling in Thrb(PV/PV) mice was confirmed
  by in situ hybridization analysis of Wnt target gene expression in bone during postnatal
  growth. By contrast, T(3) treatment inhibited Wnt signaling in osteoblastic cells,
  suggesting that T(3) inhibits the Wnt pathway by facilitating proteasomal degradation
  of Î²-catenin and preventing its accumulation in the nucleus. Activation of the
  Wnt pathway in Thrb(PV/PV) mice, however, results from a gain of function for TRÎ²(PV)
  that stabilizes Î²-catenin despite the presence of increased thyroid hormone levels.
  These studies demonstrate novel interactions between T(3) and Wnt signaling pathways
  in the regulation of skeletal development and bone formation.
