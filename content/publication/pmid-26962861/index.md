abstract: The genetic profile of human pancreatic cancers harbors considerable heterogeneity,
  which suggests a possible explanation for the pronounced inefficacy of single therapies
  in this disease. This observation has led to a belief that custom therapies based
  on individual tumor profiles are necessary to more effectively treat pancreatic
  cancer. It has recently been discovered that axon guidance genes are affected by
  somatic structural variants in up to 25% of human pancreatic cancers. Thus far,
  however, some of these mutations have only been correlated to survival probability
  and no function has been assigned to these observed axon guidance gene mutations
  in pancreatic cancer. In this study we established three novel pancreatic cancer
  cell lines and performed whole genome sequencing to discover novel mutations in
  axon guidance genes that may contribute to the cancer phenotype of these cells.
  We discovered, among other novel somatic variants in axon guidance pathway genes,
  a novel mutation in the PLXNA1 receptor (c.2587G>A) in newly established cell line
  SB.06 that mediates oncogenic cues of increased invasion and proliferation in SB.06
  cells and increased invasion in 293T cells upon stimulation with the receptor's
  natural ligand semaphorin 3A compared to wild type PLXNA1 cells. Mutant PLXNA1 signaling
  was associated with increased Rho-GTPase and p42/p44 MAPK signaling activity and
  cytoskeletal expansion, but not changes in E-cadherin, vimentin, or metalloproteinase
  9 expression levels. Pharmacologic inhibition of the Rho-GTPase family member CDC42
  selectively abrogated PLXNA1 c.2587G>A-mediated increased invasion. These findings
  provide in-vitro confirmation that somatic mutations in axon guidance genes can
  provide oncogenic gain-of-function signals and may contribute to pancreatic cancer
  progression.
