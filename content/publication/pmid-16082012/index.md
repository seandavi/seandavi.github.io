abstract: biomaRt is a new Bioconductor package that integrates BioMart data resources
  with data analysis software in Bioconductor. It can annotate a wide range of gene
  or gene product identifiers (e.g. Entrez-Gene and Affymetrix probe identifiers)
  with information such as gene symbol, chromosomal coordinates, Gene Ontology and
  OMIM annotation. Furthermore biomaRt enables retrieval of genomic sequences and
  single nucleotide polymorphism information, which can be used in data analysis.
  Fast and up-to-date data retrieval is possible as the package executes direct SQL
  queries to the BioMart databases (e.g. Ensembl). The biomaRt package provides a
  tight integration of large, public or locally installed BioMart databases with data
  analysis in Bioconductor creating a powerful environment for biological data mining.
