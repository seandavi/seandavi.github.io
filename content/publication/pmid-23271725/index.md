abstract: Genetic changes during tumorigenesis are usually acquired sequentially.
  However, a recent study showed that in 2% to 3% of all cancers a single catastrophic
  event, termed chromothripsis, can lead to massive genomic rearrangements confined
  to one or a few chromosomes. To explore whether the degree of genomic instability
  and chromothripsis influences prognosis in cancer, we retrospectively applied array-comparative
  genomic hybridization (aCGH) to 20 malignant melanomas that showed, despite comparable
  conventional clinical and pathologic parameters, a profoundly different clinical
  course. We compared 10 patients who died of malignant melanoma 3.7 years (median,
  range 0.9-7.6 years) after diagnosis with 10 patients who survived malignant melanoma
  and had a median disease-free survival of 14.8 years (range 12.5-16.7 years; P =
  0.00001). We observed a striking association between the degree of chromosomal instability,
  both numerical and structural, and outcome. Malignant melanomas associated with
  good prognosis showed only few chromosomal imbalances (mean 1.6 alterations per
  case), predominantly whole chromosome or chromosome arm gains and losses, whereas
  malignant melanomas with poor prognosis harbored significantly more chromosomal
  aberrations (13.9 per case; P = 0.008). Array-based CGH showed that these aberrations
  were mostly focal events, culminating in two cases in a pattern consistent with
  the phenomenon of chromothripsis, which was confirmed by paired-end sequencing.
  This is the first description of chromothripsis in primary malignant melanomas.
  Our study therefore links focal copy number alterations and chromothripsis with
  poor outcome in patients with malignant melanomas (P = 0.0002) and provides a genetic
  approach to predict outcome in malignant melanomas.
