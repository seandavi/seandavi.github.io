abstract: 'Brain metastases of breast cancer seem to be increasingin incidence as
  systemic therapy improves. Metastatic disease in the brain is associated with high
  morbidity and mortality. We present the first gene expression analysis of laser-captured
  epithelial cells from resected human brain metastases of breast cancer compared
  with unlinked primary breast tumors. The tumors were matched for histology, tumor-node-metastasis
  stage, and hormone receptor status. Most differentially expressed genes were down-regulated
  in the brain metastases, which included, surprisingly, many genes associated with
  metastasis. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed statistically significant
  differences or strong trends in the expression of six genes: BMP1, PEDF, LAMgamma3,
  SIAH, STHMN3, and TSPD2. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) was also of interest because of its
  increased expression in brain metastases. HK2 is important in glucose metabolism
  and apoptosis. In agreement with our microarray results, HK2 levels (both mRNA and
  protein) were elevated in a brain metastatic derivative (231-BR) of the human breast
  carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 relative to the parental cell line (231-P) in vitro.
  Knockdown of HK2 expression in 231-BR cells using short hairpin RNA reduced cell
  proliferation when cultures were maintained in glucose-limiting conditions. Finally,
  HK2 expression was analyzed in a cohort of 123 resected brain metastases of breast
  cancer. High HK2 expression was significantly associated with poor patient survival
  after craniotomy (P = 0.028). The data suggest that HK2 overexpression is associated
  with metastasis to the brain in breast cancer and it may be a therapeutic target.'
