abstract: Aberrant DNA methylation is known to be a major factor in oncogenesis and
  cancer progression, but effects of methylation in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC)
  are not well defined. The objective of the study was to identify altered methylation
  patterns, which may be associated with PTC disease behavior. This study was a genome-wide
  methylation analysis of PTC. The study was conducted at the National Institutes
  of Health Clinical Center. PTC tissue from 51 patients were analyzed and compared
  with normal thyroid tissue from seven patients. CpG methylation status was assessed
  using advanced genome-wide methylation bead chips. Altered methylation patterns
  in PTC were analyzed by stage, recurrence, histological subtype of tumor, and tumor
  genotype. PTC is globally hypomethylated compared with normal thyroid with 2837
  differentially methylated CpG sites. The follicular variant of PTC demonstrated
  less differential methylation with only 569 differentially methylated CpG sites.
  Tumors with mutations in BRAF, RET/PTC, and RAS demonstrated a 3.6-fold increase
  in the number of differentially methylated sites compared with wild-type tumors.
  The differentially methylated genes were associated with oncological pathways including
  cellular movement, growth, and proliferation. PTC is epigenetically distinct from
  the follicular variant of PTC and by gene mutation status (BRAF, RET/PTC, and RAS).
