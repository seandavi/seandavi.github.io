abstract: Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most lethal human malignancies
  that currently has no effective therapy. We performed quantitative high-throughput
  screening (qHTS) in three ATC cell lines using 3,282 clinically approved drugs and
  drug candidates, and identified 100 active agents. Enrichment analysis of active
  compounds showed that inhibitors of EGFR and histone deacetylase (HDAC) were most
  active. Of these, the first-in-class dual inhibitor of EGFR, HER2 and HDACs, CUDC-101,
  had the highest efficacy and lower IC50 than established drugs. We validated that
  CUDC-101 inhibited cellular proliferation and resulted in cell death by inducing
  cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. CUDC-101 also inhibited cellular
  migration in vitro. Mechanistically, CUDC-101 inhibited MAPK signaling and histone
  deacetylation in ATC cell lines with multiple driver mutations present in human
  ATC. The anticancer effect of CUDC-101 was associated with increased expression
  of p21 and E-cadherin, and reduced expression of survivin, XIAP, Î²-catenin, N-cadherin,
  and Vimentin. In an in vivo mouse model of metastatic ATC, CUDC-101 inhibited tumor
  growth and metastases, and significantly prolonged survival. Response to CUDC-101
  treatment in vivo was associated with increased histone 3 acetylation and reduced
  survivin expression. Our findings provide a preclinical basis to evaluate CUDC-101
  therapy in ATC.
