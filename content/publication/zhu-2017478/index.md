abstract: 'Summary Humans with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal
  dystrophy (APECED), a T cell-driven autoimmune disease caused by impaired central
  tolerance, are susceptible to chronic fungal infection and esophageal squamous cell
  carcinoma (ESCC). However, the relationship between autoreactive T cells and chronic
  fungal infection in ESCC development remains unclear. We find that kinase-dead Ikkα
  knockin mice develop APECED-like phenotypes, including impaired central tolerance,
  autoreactive T cells, chronic fungal infection, and ESCCs expressing specific human
  ESCC markers. Using this model, we investigated the link between ESCC and fungal
  infection. Autoreactive CD4 T cells permit fungal infection and incite tissue injury
  and inflammation. Antifungal treatment or autoreactive CD4 T cell depletion rescues,
  whereas oral fungal administration promotes, ESCC development. Inhibition of inflammation
  or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity decreases fungal burden. Fungal
  infection is highly associated with ESCCs in non-autoimmune human patients. Therefore,
  autoreactive T cells and chronic fungal infection, fostered by inflammation and
  epithelial injury, promote ESCC development. '
