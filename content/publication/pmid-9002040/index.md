abstract: A common strategy for testing for linkage without posing a disease model
  is to test for increased marker similarity among the affected pedigree members.
  We developed a simulation based statistic, SimIBD, which measures marker similarity
  in terms of identity-by-descent (IBD) when it can be determined whether or not the
  alleles are IBD, and in terms of the probability of the alleles being IBD when it
  cannot be determined. The SimIBD statistic is not only more powerful than its precursor,
  the affected-pedigree-member (APM) method, but it is also less sensitive to the
  misspecification of marker allele frequencies.
