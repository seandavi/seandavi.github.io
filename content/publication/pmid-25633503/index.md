abstract: Bioconductor is an open-source, open-development software project for the
  analysis and comprehension of high-throughput data in genomics and molecular biology.
  The project aims to enable interdisciplinary research, collaboration and rapid development
  of scientific software. Based on the statistical programming language R, Bioconductor
  comprises 934 interoperable packages contributed by a large, diverse community of
  scientists. Packages cover a range of bioinformatic and statistical applications.
  They undergo formal initial review and continuous automated testing. We present
  an overview for prospective users and contributors.
