abstract: We have analyzed the GAW10 data from several studies of bipolar affective
  disorder (BPAD) using the software packages SimIBD and SIMWALK2. SimIBD implements
  a simulation-based affected-pedigree-member (APM) statistic, called SimAPM, as well
  as an APM-like statistic, also called SimIBD, that measures identical-by-descent
  (IBD) sharing. SIMWALK2 uses Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to compute several
  IBD-based statistics on the degree of marker-allele clustering among all affected
  relatives. We have found no strong evidence of linkage to either chromosome 5 or
  18. However, we did find that several markers showed p-values less than 0.01 and
  may deserve further study.
