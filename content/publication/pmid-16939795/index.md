abstract: 'Data obtained from high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays present new
  computational challenges for users. This chapter presents ACME (Algorithm for Capturing
  Microarray Enrichment), a computer program developed for the analysis of data obtained
  using NimbleGen-tiled microarrays. ACME identifies signals or \"peaks\" in tiled
  array data using a simple sliding window and threshold strategy and assigns a probability
  value (p value) to each and every probe on the array. We present data indicating
  that this approach can be applied successfully to at least two different genomic
  applications involving tiled arrays: ChIP-chip and DNase-chip. In addition to highlighting
  previously described methods for analyzing tiled array data, we provide recommendations
  for assessing the quality of ChIP-chip and DNase-chip data, suggestions for optimizing
  the use of ACME, and descriptions of several of ACME features designed to facilitate
  interpretation of processed tiled array data. ACME is written in R language and
  is freely available upon request or through Bioconductor.'
