abstract: Next-generation sequencing technologies can now be used to directly measure
  heritable de novo DNA sequence mutations in humans. However, these techniques have
  not been used to examine environmental factors that induce such mutations and their
  associated diseases. To address this issue, a working group on environmentally induced
  germline mutation analysis (ENIGMA) met in October 2011 to propose the necessary
  foundational studies, which include sequencing of parent-offspring trios from highly
  exposed human populations, and controlled dose-response experiments in animals.
  These studies will establish background levels of variability in germline mutation
  rates and identify environmental agents that influence these rates and heritable
  disease. Guidance for the types of exposures to examine come from rodent studies
  that have identified agents such as cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, ionizing radiation,
  cigarette smoke, and air pollution as germ-cell mutagens. Research is urgently needed
  to establish the health consequences of parental exposures on subsequent generations.
