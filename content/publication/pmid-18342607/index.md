abstract: The generality and spectrum of chromatin-remodeling requirements for nuclear
  receptor function are unknown. We have characterized glucocorticoid receptor (GR)
  binding events and chromatin structural transitions across GR-induced or -repressed
  genes. This analysis reveals that GR binding invariably occurs at nuclease-accessible
  sites (DHS). A remarkable diversity of mechanisms, however, render these sites available
  for GR binding. Accessibility of the GR binding sites is either constitutive or
  hormone inducible. Within each category, some DHS sites require the Brg1-containing
  Swi/Snf complex, but others are Brg1 independent, implicating a different remodeling
  complex. The H2A.Z histone variant is highly enriched at both inducible and constitutive
  DHS sites and is subject to exchange during hormone activation. The DHS profile
  is highly cell specific, implicating cell-selective organization of the chromatin
  landscape as a critical determinant of tissue-selective receptor function. Furthermore,
  the widespread requirement for chromatin remodeling supports the recent hypothesis
  that the rapid exchange of receptor proteins occurs during nucleosome reorganization.
