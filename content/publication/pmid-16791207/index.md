abstract: Mapping DNase I hypersensitive sites is an accurate method of identifying
  the location of gene regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers
  and locus control regions. Although Southern blots are the traditional method of
  identifying DNase I hypersensitive sites, the conventional manual method is not
  readily scalable to studying large chromosomal regions, much less the entire genome.
  Here we describe DNase-chip, an approach that can rapidly identify DNase I hypersensitive
  sites for any region of interest, or potentially for the entire genome, by using
  tiled microarrays. We used DNase-chip to identify DNase I hypersensitive sites accurately
  from a representative 1% of the human genome in both primary and immortalized cell
  types. We found that although most DNase I hypersensitive sites were present in
  both cell types studied, some of them were cell-type specific. This method can be
  applied globally or in a targeted fashion to any tissue from any species with a
  sequenced genome.
