abstract: CHEK2 encodes a serine/threonine kinase (Chk2) activated by ATM in response
  to DNA double-strand breaks. On the one hand, CHEK2 has been described as a tumor
  suppressor with proapoptotic, cell-cycle checkpoint and mitotic functions. On the
  other hand, Chk2 is also commonly activated (phosphorylated at T68) in cancers and
  precancerous lesions. Here, we report an extensive characterization of CHEK2 across
  the panel of 60 established cancer cell lines from the NCI Anticancer Screen (the
  NCI-60) using genomic and proteomic analyses, including exon-specific mRNA expression,
  DNA copy-number variation (CNV) by aCGH, exome sequencing, as well as western blot
  analyses for total and activated (pT68-Chk2) Chk2. We show that the high heterogeneity
  of Chk2 levels in cancer cells is primarily due to its inactivation (owing to low
  gene expression, alternative splicing, point mutations, copy-number alterations
  and premature truncation) or reduction of protein levels. Moreover, we observe that
  a significant percentage of cancer cells (12% of the NCI-60 and HeLa cells) show
  high endogenous Chk2 activation, which is always associated with p53 inactivation,
  and which is accompanied by downregulation of the Fanconi anemia and homologous
  recombination pathways. We also report the presence of activated Chk2 (pT68-Chk2)
  along with histone Î³-H2AX in centrosomes.
