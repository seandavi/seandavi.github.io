abstract: Microarray technology has become a standard molecular biology tool. Experimental
  data have been generated on a huge number of organisms, tissue types, treatment
  conditions and disease states. The Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al., 2005),
  developed by the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI) at the National Institutes
  of Health is a repository of nearly 140,000 gene expression experiments. The BioConductor
  project (Gentleman et al., 2004) is an open-source and open-development software
  project built in the R statistical programming environment (R Development core Team,
  2005) for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. The tools contained in
  the BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for the analysis
  of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a software tool that allows access
  to the wealth of information within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating
  many the formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses labor-intensive
  in the past. The software, called GEOquery, effectively establishes a bridge between
  GEO and BioConductor. Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead
  to new analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and bioinformatic
  tools. Facilitating analyses and meta-analyses of microarray data will increase
  the efficiency with which biologically important conclusions can be drawn from published
  genomic data. GEOquery is available as part of the BioConductor project.
