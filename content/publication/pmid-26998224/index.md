abstract: Bioconductor ( bioconductor.org) is a rich source of software and know-how
  for the integrative analysis of genomic data. The Bioconductor channel in F1000Research
  provides a forum for task-oriented workflows that cover a solution to a current,
  important problem in genome-scale data analysis. It also hosts manuscripts describing
  software packages, package-based vignettes, teaching labs, benchmark studies, methodological
  reviews and bioinformatics software oriented perspective papers.
