abstract: "Genetic epidemiological studies have shown that genetic factors are important in the pathogenesis of the idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC). A genome screen in the United Kingdom found linkage of IBD to a 41-cM region of chromosome 12, surrounding D12S83. We aimed to replicate this linkage and to narrow the region of interest. Nonparametric linkage analyses at microsatellites surrounding D12S83 were performed in 122 North American Caucasian families containing 208 genotyped IBD-affected relative pairs. Transmission/disequilibrium tests (TDTs) were also performed. We confirmed that IBD is linked to chromosome 12 (peak GENEHUNTER-PLUS LOD* score 2.76 [P = .00016] between D12S1724 and D12S90). The evidence for linkage is contributed by both the group of CD-affected relative pairs (peak GENEHUNTER-PLUS LOD* score 1.79 [P = .0021] between D12S1724 and D12S90) and the group of UC-affected relative pairs (peak GENEHUNTER-PLUS LOD* score 1.82 [P = .0019] at D12S335). The TDT is positive at the D12S83 locus (global chi2 = 16.41, 6 df, P = .012). In conclusion, we have independently confirmed linkage of IBD to the chromosome 12 region that we investigated. A positive TDT at D12S83 suggests that we have greatly narrowed the chromosome 12 region that contains an IBD locus."
