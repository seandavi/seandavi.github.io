abstract: Genetic epidemiological studies have shown that genetic factors are important
  in the pathogenesis of the idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn disease
  (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC). A genome screen in the United Kingdom found linkage
  of IBD to a 41-cM region of chromosome 12, surrounding D12S83. We aimed to replicate
  this linkage and to narrow the region of interest. Nonparametric linkage analyses
  at microsatellites surrounding D12S83 were performed in 122 North American Caucasian
  families containing 208 genotyped IBD-affected relative pairs. Transmission/disequilibrium
  tests (TDTs) were also performed. We confirmed that IBD is linked to chromosome
  12 (peak GENEHUNTER-PLUS LOD* score 2.76 [P = .00016] between D12S1724 and D12S90).
  The evidence for linkage is contributed by both the group of CD-affected relative
  pairs (peak GENEHUNTER-PLUS LOD* score 1.79 [P = .0021] between D12S1724 and D12S90)
  and the group of UC-affected relative pairs (peak GENEHUNTER-PLUS LOD* score 1.82
  [P = .0019] at D12S335). The TDT is positive at the D12S83 locus (global chi2 =
  16.41, 6 df, P = .012). In conclusion, we have independently confirmed linkage of
  IBD to the chromosome 12 region that we investigated. A positive TDT at D12S83 suggests
  that we have greatly narrowed the chromosome 12 region that contains an IBD locus.
