abstract: Our analysis of GAW10 problem 2 data set consisted of linear regression
  analysis followed by linkage analysis. The linear regression analysis allowed some
  exploration of the relationships between the quantitative variables. Furthermore,
  it isolated some of the components of certain quantitative variables that were not
  due to a major locus and facilitated the linkage analysis that followed. For the
  linkage analysis, we used MAPMAKER/SIBS and the SIBPAL program from S.A.G.E. We
  found linkage of Q4 to chromosome 8. Analysis using the residuals of Q1 and Q3 showed
  linkage to chromosomes 5 and 4, respectively.
