abstract: Hypertension is a significant risk factor for heart attack and stroke and
  represents a major public health burden because of its high prevalence (e.g. 15-20%
  of the European and American populations). Although blood pressure is known to have
  a strong genetic determination, the genes responsible for susceptibility to essential
  hypertension are mostly unknown. Loci involved in blood pressure regulation have
  been found by linkage in experimental hereditary hypertensive rat strains, but their
  relationship to human hypertension has not been extensively investigated. One of
  the principal blood pressure loci has been mapped to rat chromosome 10 and we have
  undertaken an investigation of the homologous region on human chromosome 17 in familial
  essential hypertension. Affected sib-pair analysis and parametric analysis with
  ascertainment correction gave significant evidence of linkage ( P <0.0001 in some
  analyses) near two closely linked microsatellite markers, D17S183 and D17S934, that
  reside 18 cM proximal to the ACE locus in the homology region. Our results indicate
  that chromosome 17q could contain a susceptibility locus for human hypertension
  and show that comparative mapping may be a useful approach for identification of
  such loci in humans.
