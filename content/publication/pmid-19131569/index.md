abstract: We have characterized the kinetic response of gene targets throughout the
  murine genome to transcriptional modulation by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).
  In contrast to a model in which multiple genes are either repressed or activated
  during the GR response, the vast majority of responsive genes are subject to complex
  regulation profiles, frequently with alternate activation and repression phases.
  We also observe that GR binding at response elements does not always correlate with
  the target gene response profile. Thus, the cellular response to GR stimulation
  involves a highly orchestrated series of regulatory actions and not simply a binary
  response to hormone.
