abstract: 'As chemotherapy and molecular therapy improve the systemic survival of
  breast cancer patients, the incidence of brain metastases increases. Few therapeutic
  strategies exist for the treatment of brain metastases because the blood-brain barrier
  severely limits drug access. We report the pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and mechanism
  of action studies for the histone deactylase inhibitor vorinostat (suberoylanilide
  hydroxamic acid) in a preclinical model of brain metastasis of triple-negative breast
  cancer. The 231-BR brain trophic subline of the MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell
  line was injected into immunocompromised mice for pharmacokinetic and metastasis
  studies. Pharmacodynamic studies compared histone acetylation, apoptosis, proliferation,
  and DNA damage in vitro and in vivo. Following systemic administration, uptake of
  [(14)C]vorinostat was significant into normal rodent brain and accumulation was
  up to 3-fold higher in a proportion of metastases formed by 231-BR cells. Vorinostat
  prevented the development of 231-BR micrometastases by 28% (P = 0.017) and large
  metastases by 62% (P < 0.0001) compared with vehicle-treated mice when treatment
  was initiated on day 3 post-injection. The inhibitory activity of vorinostat as
  a single agent was linked to a novel function in vivo: induction of DNA double-strand
  breaks associated with the down-regulation of the DNA repair gene Rad52. We report
  the first preclinical data for the prevention of brain metastasis of triple-negative
  breast cancer. Vorinostat is brain permeable and can prevent the formation of brain
  metastases by 62%. Its mechanism of action involves the induction of DNA double-strand
  breaks, suggesting rational combinations with DNA active drugs or radiation.'
