abstract: Bioconductor's SummarizedExperiment class unites numerical assay quantifications
  with sample- and experiment-level metadata. SummarizedExperiment is the standard
  Bioconductor class for assays that produce matrix-like data, used by over 200 packages.
  We describe the restfulSE package, a deployment of this data model that supports
  remote storage. We illustrate use of SummarizedExperiment with remote HDF5 and Google
  BigQuery back ends, with two applications in cancer genomics. Our intent is to allow
  the use of familiar and semantically meaningful programmatic idioms to query genomic
  data, while abstracting the remote interface from end users and developers.
