 abstract = {Motivation: The Bioconductor project, a large collection of open
source software for the comprehension of large-scale biological
data, continues to grow with new packages added each week,
motivating the development of software tools focused on exposing
package metadata to developers and users. The resulting
BiocPkgTools package facilitates access to extensive metadata in
computable form covering the Bioconductor package ecosystem,
facilitating downstream applications such as custom reporting,
data and text mining of Bioconductor package text descriptions,
graph analytics over package dependencies, and custom search
approaches. Results: The BiocPkgTools package has been
incorporated into the Bioconductor project, installs using
standard procedures, and runs on any system supporting R. It
provides functions to load detailed package metadata,
longitudinal package download statistics, package dependencies,
and Bioconductor build reports, all in ``tidy data'' form.
BiocPkgTools can convert from tidy data structures to graph
structures, enabling graph-based analytics and visualization. An
end-user-friendly graphical package explorer aids in task-centric
package discovery. Full documentation and example use cases are
included. Availability: The BiocPkgTools software and complete
documentation are available from Bioconductor (
https://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocPkgTools).},
