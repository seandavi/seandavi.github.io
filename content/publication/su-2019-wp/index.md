abstract: "Motivation: The Bioconductor project, a large collection of open source\
  \ software for the comprehension of large-scale biological data, continues to grow\
  \ with new packages added each week, motivating the development of software tools\
  \ focused on exposing package metadata to developers and users. The resulting BiocPkgTools\
  \ package facilitates access to extensive metadata in computable form covering the\
  \ Bioconductor package ecosystem, facilitating downstream applications such as custom\
  \ reporting, data and text mining of Bioconductor package text descriptions, graph\
  \ analytics over package dependencies, and custom search approaches. Results: The\
  \ BiocPkgTools package has been incorporated into the Bioconductor project, installs\
  \ using standard procedures, and runs on any system supporting R. It provides functions\
  \ to load detailed package metadata, longitudinal package download statistics, package\
  \ dependencies, and Bioconductor build reports, all in ``tidy data'' form. BiocPkgTools\
  \ can convert from tidy data structures to graph structures, enabling graph-based\
  \ analytics and visualization. An end-user-friendly graphical package explorer aids\
  \ in task-centric package discovery. Full documentation and example use cases are\
  \ included. Availability: The BiocPkgTools software and complete documentation are\
  \ available from Bioconductor ( https://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocPkgTools)."
