abstract: Analysis of molecular aberrations across multiple cancer types, known as
  pan-cancer analysis, identifies commonalities and differences in key biological
  processes that are dysregulated in cancer cells from diverse lineages. Pan-cancer
  analyses have been performed for adult but not paediatric cancers, which commonly
  occur in developing mesodermic rather than adult epithelial tissues. Here we present
  a pan-cancer study of somatic alterations, including single nucleotide variants,
  small insertions or deletions, structural variations, copy number alterations, gene
  fusions and internal tandem duplications in 1,699 paediatric leukaemias and solid
  tumours across six histotypes, with whole-genome, whole-exome and transcriptome
  sequencing data processed under a uniform analytical framework. We report 142 driver
  genes in paediatric cancers, of which only 45% match those found in adult pan-cancer
  studies; copy number alterations and structural variants constituted the majority
  (62%) of events. Eleven genome-wide mutational signatures were identified, including
  one attributed to ultraviolet-light exposure in eight aneuploid leukaemias. Transcription
  of the mutant allele was detectable for 34% of protein-coding mutations, and 20%
  exhibited allele-specific expression. These data provide a comprehensive genomic
  architecture for paediatric cancers and emphasize the need for paediatric cancer-specific
  development of precision therapies.
