abstract: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN1) is a familial cancer syndrome
  characterized primarily by tumors of multiple endocrine glands. The gene for MEN1
  encodes a ubiquitously expressed tumor suppressor protein called menin. Menin was
  recently shown to interact with several components of a trithorax family histone
  methyltransferase complex including ASH2, Rbbp5, WDR5, and the leukemia proto-oncoprotein
  MLL. To elucidate menin's role as a tumor suppressor and gain insights into the
  endocrine-specific tumor phenotype in MEN1, we mapped the genomic binding sites
  of menin, MLL1, and Rbbp5, to approximately 20,000 promoters in HeLa S3, HepG2,
  and pancreatic islet cells using the strategy of chromatin-immunoprecipitation coupled
  with microarray analysis. We found that menin, MLL1, and Rbbp5 localize to the promoters
  of thousands of human genes but do not always bind together. These data suggest
  that menin functions as a general regulator of transcription. We also found that
  factor occupancy generally correlates with high gene expression but that the loss
  of menin does not result in significant changes in most transcript levels. One exception
  is the developmentally programmed transcription factor, HLXB9, which is overexpressed
  in islets in the absence of menin. Our findings expand the realm of menin-targeted
  genes several hundred-fold beyond that previously described and provide potential
  insights to the endocrine tumor bias observed in MEN1 patients.
