abstract: The domestic dog exhibits greater diversity in body size than any other
  terrestrial vertebrate. We used a strategy that exploits the breed structure of
  dogs to investigate the genetic basis of size. First, through a genome-wide scan,
  we identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 15 influencing
  size variation within a single breed. Second, we examined genetic variation in the
  15-megabase interval surrounding the QTL in small and giant breeds and found marked
  evidence for a selective sweep spanning a single gene (IGF1), encoding insulin-like
  growth factor 1. A single IGF1 single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotype is common
  to all small breeds and nearly absent from giant breeds, suggesting that the same
  causal sequence variant is a major contributor to body size in all small dogs.
