abstract: In order to develop a xenograft model to determine the efficacy of new therapies
  against primary human precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) stem cells
  (LSCs), we used the highly immunodeficient non-obese diabetic (NOD).Cg-Prkdc(scid)IL2rg(tmlWjl)/SzJ
  (NOD-severe combined immune deficient (scid) IL2rg(-/-)) mouse strain. Intravenous
  transplantation of 2 of 2 ALL cell lines and 9 of 14 primary ALL cases generated
  leukemia-like proliferations in recipient mice by 1-7 months after transplant. Leukemias
  were retransplantable, and the immunophenotypes, gene rearrangements and expression
  profiles were identical or similar to those of the original primary samples. NOD-scid
  mice transplanted with the same primary samples developed similar leukemias with
  only a slightly longer latency than did NOD-scid-IL2Rg(-/-) mice. In this highly
  sensitive NOD-scid-IL2Rg(-/-)-based assay, 1-100 unsorted primary human ALL cells
  from five of five tested patients, four of whom eventually experienced leukemia
  relapse, generated leukemias in recipient mice. This very high frequency of LSCs
  suggests that a hierarchical LSC model is not valuable for poor-outcome ALL.
