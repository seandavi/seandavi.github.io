abstract: To understand the genetic mechanisms driving variant and IGHV4-34-expressing
  hairy-cell leukemias, we performed whole-exome sequencing of leukemia samples from
  ten affected individuals, including six with matched normal samples. We identified
  activating mutations in the MAP2K1 gene (encoding MEK1) in 5 of these 10 samples
  and in 10 of 21 samples in a validation set (overall frequency of 15/31), suggesting
  potential new strategies for treating individuals with these diseases.
