abstract: "Replication of mammalian genomes requires the activation of thousands of\
  \ origins which are both spatially and temporally regulated by as yet unknown mechanisms.\
  \ At the most fundamental level, our knowledge about the distribution pattern of\
  \ origins in each of the chromosomes, among different cell types, and whether the\
  \ physiological state of the cells alters this distribution is at present very limited.\
  \ We have used standard Î»-exonuclease resistant nascent DNA preparations in the\
  \ size range of 0.7-1.5 kb obtained from the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 hybridized\
  \ to a custom tiling array containing 50-60 nt probes evenly distributed among genic\
  \ and non-genic regions covering about 1% of the human genome. A similar DNA preparation\
  \ was used for high-throughput DNA sequencing. Array experiments were also performed\
  \ with DNA obtained from BT-474 and H520 cell lines. By determining the sites showing\
  \ nascent DNA enrichment, we have localized several thousand origins of DNA replication.\
  \ Our major findings are: (a) both array and DNA sequencing assay methods produced\
  \ essentially the same origin distribution profile; (b) origin distribution is largely\
  \ conserved (>70%) in all cell lines tested; (c) origins are enriched at the 5'ends\
  \ of expressed genes and at evolutionarily conserved intergenic sequences; and (d)\
  \ ChIP on chip experiments in MCF-7 showed an enrichment of H3K4Me3 and RNA Polymerase\
  \ II chromatin binding sites at origins of DNA replication. Our results suggest\
  \ that the program for origin activation is largely conserved among different cell\
  \ types. Also, our work supports recent studies connecting transcription initiation\
  \ with replication, and in addition suggests that evolutionarily conserved intergenic\
  \ sequences have the potential to participate in origin selection. Overall, our\
  \ observations suggest that replication origin selection is a stochastic process\
  \ significantly dependent upon local accessibility to replication factors."
