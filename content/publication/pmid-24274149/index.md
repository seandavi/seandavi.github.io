abstract: Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS) is a myogenic childhood sarcoma frequently
  associated with a translocation-mediated fusion gene, Pax3:Foxo1a. We investigated
  the complementary role of Rb1 loss in aRMS tumor initiation and progression using
  conditional mouse models. Rb1 loss was not a necessary and sufficient mutational
  event for rhabdomyosarcomagenesis, nor a strong cooperative initiating mutation.
  Instead, Rb1 loss was a modifier of progression and increased anaplasia and pleomorphism.
  Whereas Pax3:Foxo1a expression was unaltered, biomarkers of aRMS versus embryonal
  rhabdomyosarcoma were both increased, questioning whether these diagnostic markers
  are reliable in the context of Rb1 loss. Genome-wide gene expression in Pax3:Foxo1a,Rb1
  tumors more closely approximated aRMS than embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Intrinsic
  loss of pRb function in aRMS was evidenced by insensitivity to a Cdk4/6 inhibitor
  regardless of whether Rb1 was intact or null. This loss of function could be attributed
  to low baseline Rb1, pRb and phospho-pRb expression in aRMS tumors for which the
  Rb1 locus was intact. Pax3:Foxo1a RNA interference did not increase pRb or improve
  Cdk inhibitor sensitivity. Human aRMS shared the feature of low and/or heterogeneous
  tumor cell pRb expression. Rb1 loss from an already low pRb baseline is a significant
  disease modifier, raising the possibility that some cases of pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma
  may in fact be Pax3:Foxo1a-expressing aRMS with Rb1 or pRb loss of function.
