abstract: The importance of bioinformatics, computational biology, and data science
  in biomedical research continues to grow, driving a need for effective instruction
  and education. A workshop setting, with lectures and guided hands-on tutorials,
  is a common approach to teaching practical computational and analytical methods.
  Here, we detail the process we used to produce high-quality, community-authored
  educational materials that are available for public consumption and reuse. The coordinated
  efforts of 17 authors over 10 weeks resulted in 15 workshops available as a website
  and as a 388-page electronic book. We describe how we utilized cloud infrastructure,
  GitHub, and a literate programming approach to robustly deliver hands-on tutorials
  to participants of the annual Bioconductor conference. The scripts, raw and published
  workshop materials, and cloud machine image are all openly available. Our approach
  uses free services and software and can be adapted by workshop organizers and authors
  in other contests with appropriate technical backgrounds.
