 abstract = {The importance of bioinformatics, computational biology, and data
science in biomedical research continues to grow, driving a need
for effective instruction and education. A workshop setting, with
lectures and guided hands-on tutorials, is a common approach to
teaching practical computational and analytical methods. Here, we
detail the process we used to produce high-quality,
community-authored educational materials that are available for
public consumption and reuse. The coordinated efforts of 17
authors over 10 weeks resulted in 15 workshops available as a
website and as a 388-page electronic book. We describe how we
utilized cloud infrastructure, GitHub, and a literate programming
approach to robustly deliver hands-on tutorials to participants
of the annual Bioconductor conference. The scripts, raw and
published workshop materials, and cloud machine image are all
openly available. Our approach uses free services and software
and can be adapted by workshop organizers and authors in other
contests with appropriate technical backgrounds.},
