abstract: Molecular interrogation of a biological sample through DNA sequencing, RNA
  and microRNA profiling, proteomics and other assays, has the potential to provide
  a systems level approach to predicting treatment response and disease progression,
  and to developing precision therapies. Large publicly funded projects have generated
  extensive and freely available multi-assay data resources; however, bioinformatic
  and statistical methods for the analysis of such experiments are still nascent.
  We review multi-assay genomic data resources in the areas of clinical oncology,
  pharmacogenomics and other perturbation experiments, population genomics and regulatory
  genomics and other areas, and tools for data acquisition. Finally, we review bioinformatic
  tools that are explicitly geared toward integrative genomic data visualization and
  analysis. This review provides starting points for accessing publicly available
  data and tools to support development of needed integrative methods.
