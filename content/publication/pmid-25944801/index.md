abstract: Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare but lethal malignancy without
  any effective therapy. The aim of this study is to use a high-throughput drug library
  screening to identify a novel therapeutic agent that targets dysregulated genes/pathways
  in ATC. We performed quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) in ATC cell lines
  using a compound library of 3,282 drugs. Dysregulated genes in ATC were analyzed
  using genome-wide expression analysis and immunohistochemistry in human ATC tissue
  samples and ATC cell lines. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed for determining
  drug activity, effectiveness of targeting, and the mechanism of action. qHTS identified
  100 active compounds in three ATC cell lines. One of the most active agents was
  the first-in-class survivin inhibitor YM155. Genome-wide expression analysis and
  immunohistochemistry showed overexpression of survivin in human ATC tissue samples,
  and survivin was highly expressed in all ATC cell lines tested. YM155 significantly
  inhibited ATC cellular proliferation. Mechanistically, YM155 inhibited survivin
  expression in ATC cells. Furthermore, YM155 treatment reduced claspin expression,
  which was associated with S-phase arrest in ATC cells. In vivo, YM155 significantly
  inhibited growth and metastases and prolonged survival. Our data show that YM155
  is a promising anticancer agent for ATC and that its target, survivin, is overexpressed
  in ATC. Our findings support the use of YM155 in clinical trials as a therapeutic
  option in advanced and metastatic ATC.
