abstract: Identification of prognostic gene expression signatures may enable improved
  decisions about management of breast cancer. To identify a prognostic signature
  for breast cancer, we performed DNA methylation profiling and identified methylation
  markers that were associated with expression of ER, PR, HER2, CK5/6, and EGFR proteins.
  Methylation markers that were correlated with corresponding mRNA expression levels
  were identified using 208 invasive tumors from a population-based case-control study
  conducted in Poland. Using this approach, we defined the methylation expression
  index (MEI) signature that was based on a weighted sum of mRNA levels of 57 genes.
  Classification of cases as low or high MEI scores was related to survival using
  Cox regression models. In the Polish study, women with ER-positive low MEI cancers
  had reduced survival at a median of 5.20 years of follow-up, HR = 2.85 95% CI =
  1.25-6.47. Low MEI was also related to decreased survival in four independent datasets
  totaling over 2500 ER-positive breast cancers. These results suggest that integrated
  analysis of tumor expression markers, DNA methylation, and mRNA data may be an important
  approach for identifying breast cancer prognostic signatures. Prospective assessment
  of MEI along with other prognostic signatures should be evaluated in future studies.
