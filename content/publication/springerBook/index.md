abstract = "This volume expands on statistical analysis ofgenomic data by discussing cross-cutting groundworkmaterial, public data repositories, commonapplications, and representative tools for operatingon genomic data. Statistical Genomics: Methods andProtocols is divided into four sections. The firstsection discusses overview material and resourcesthat can be applied across topics mentionedthroughout the book. The second section coversprominent public repositories for genomic data. Thethird section presents several different biologicalapplications of statistical genomics, and the fourthsection highlights software tools that can be usedto facilitate ad hoc analysis and dataintegration. Written in the highly successfulMethods in Molecular Biology series format, chaptersinclude introductions to their respective topics,step-by-step, readily reproducible analysisprotocols, and tips on troubleshooting and avoidingknown pitfalls. Thorough and practical, **StatisticalGenomics: Methods and Protocols**, explores a range ofboth applications and tools and is ideal for anyoneinterested in the statistical analysis of genomicdata."
