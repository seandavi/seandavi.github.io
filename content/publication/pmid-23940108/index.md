abstract: Deregulated E2F transcription factor activity occurs in the vast majority
  of human tumors and has been solidly implicated in disturbances of cell cycle control,
  proliferation, and apoptosis. Aberrant E2F regulatory activity is often caused by
  impairment of control through pRB function, but little is known about the interplay
  of other oncoproteins with E2F. Here we show that ETS transcription factor fusions
  resulting from disease driving rearrangements in Ewing sarcoma (ES) and prostate
  cancer (PC) are one such class of oncoproteins. We performed an integrative study
  of genome-wide DNA-binding and transcription data in EWSR1/FLI1 expressing ES and
  TMPRSS2/ERG containing PC cells. Supported by promoter activity and mutation analyses,
  we demonstrate that a large fraction of E2F3 target genes are synergistically coregulated
  by these aberrant ETS proteins. We propose that the oncogenic effect of ETS fusion
  oncoproteins is in part mediated by the disruptive effect of the E2F-ETS interaction
  on cell cycle control. Additionally, a detailed analysis of the regulatory targets
  of the characteristic EWSR1/FLI1 fusion in ES identifies two functionally distinct
  gene sets. While synergistic regulation in concert with E2F in the promoter of target
  genes has a generally activating effect, EWSR1/FLI1 binding independent of E2F3
  is predominantly associated with repressed differentiation genes. Thus, EWSR1/FLI1
  appears to promote oncogenesis by simultaneously promoting cell proliferation and
  perturbing differentiation.
