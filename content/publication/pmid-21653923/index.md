abstract: 'Chromosomal translocations generating oncogenic transcription factors are
  the hallmark of a variety of tumors, including many sarcomas. Ewing sarcoma family
  of tumors (ESFTs) are characterized by the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation that
  generates the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 and Friend leukemia virus integration
  1 (EWS-FLI1) fusion transcription factor responsible for the highly malignant phenotype
  of this tumor. Although continued expression of EWS-FLI1 is believed to be critical
  for ESFT cell survival, a clinically effective small-molecule inhibitor remains
  elusive likely because EWS-FLI1 is a transcription factor and therefore widely felt
  to be \"undruggable.\" We developed a high-throughput screen to evaluate more than
  50 000 compounds for inhibition of EWS-FLI1 activity in TC32 ESFT cells. We used
  a TC32 cell-based luciferase reporter screen using the EWS-FLI1 downstream target
  NR0B1 promoter and a gene signature secondary screen to sort and prioritize the
  compounds. We characterized the lead compound, mithramycin, based on its ability
  to inhibit EWS-FLI1 activity in vitro using microarray expression profiling, quantitative
  reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblot analysis, and in
  vivo using immunohistochemistry. We studied the impact of this inhibition on cell
  viability in vitro and on tumor growth in ESFT xenograft models in vivo (n = 15-20
  mice per group). All statistical tests were two-sided. Mithramycin inhibited expression
  of EWS-FLI1 downstream targets at the mRNA and protein levels and decreased the
  growth of ESFT cells at half maximal inhibitory concentrations between 10 (95% confidence
  interval [CI] = 8 to 13 nM) and 15 nM (95% CI = 13 to 19 nM). Mithramycin suppressed
  the growth of two different ESFT xenograft tumors and prolonged the survival of
  ESFT xenograft-bearing mice by causing a decrease in mean tumor volume. For example,
  in the TC32 xenograft model, on day 15 of treatment, the mean tumor volume for the
  mithramycin-treated mice was approximately 3% of the tumor volume observed in the
  control mice (mithramycin vs control: 69 vs 2388 mm(3), difference = 2319 mm(3),
  95% CI = 1766 to 2872 mm(3), P < .001). Mithramycin inhibits EWS-FLI1 activity and
  demonstrates ESFT antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo.'
