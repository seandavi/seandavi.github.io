abstract: Limited information is available regarding epigenomic events mediating initiation
  and progression of tobacco-induced lung cancers. In this study, we established an
  in vitro system to examine epigenomic effects of cigarette smoke in respiratory
  epithelia. Normal human small airway epithelial cells and cdk-4/hTERT-immortalized
  human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) were cultured in normal media with or without
  cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) for up to 9 months under potentially relevant exposure
  conditions. Western blot analysis showed that CSC mediated dose- and time-dependent
  diminution of H4K16Ac and H4K20Me3, while increasing relative levels of H3K27Me3;
  these histone alterations coincided with decreased DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)
  and increased DNMT3b expression. Pyrosequencing and quantitative RT-PCR experiments
  revealed time-dependent hypomethylation of D4Z4, NBL2, and LINE-1 repetitive DNA
  sequences; up-regulation of H19, IGF2, MAGE-A1, and MAGE-A3; activation of Wnt signaling;
  and hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes such as RASSF1A and RAR-beta, which
  are frequently silenced in human lung cancers. Array-based DNA methylation profiling
  identified additional novel DNA methylation targets in soft-agar clones derived
  from CSC-exposed HBEC; a CSC gene expression signature was also identified in these
  cells. Progressive genomic hypomethylation and locoregional DNA hypermethylation
  induced by CSC coincided with a dramatic increase in soft-agar clonogenicity. Collectively,
  these data indicate that cigarette smoke induces 'cancer-associated' epigenomic
  alterations in cultured respiratory epithelia. This in vitro model may prove useful
  for delineating early epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression during pulmonary
  carcinogenesis.
