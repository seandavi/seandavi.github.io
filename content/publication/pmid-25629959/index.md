abstract: Melanoma is the most fatal skin cancer, but the etiology of this devastating
  disease is still poorly understood. Recently, the transcription factor Sox10 has
  been shown to promote both melanoma initiation and progression. Reducing SOX10 expression
  levels in human melanoma cells and in a genetic melanoma mouse model, efficiently
  abolishes tumorigenesis by inducing cell cycle exit and apoptosis. Here, we show
  that this anti-tumorigenic effect functionally involves SOX9, a factor related to
  SOX10 and upregulated in melanoma cells upon loss of SOX10. Unlike SOX10, SOX9 is
  not required for normal melanocyte stem cell function, the formation of hyperplastic
  lesions, and melanoma initiation. To the contrary, SOX9 overexpression results in
  cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and a gene expression profile shared by melanoma cells
  with reduced SOX10 expression. Moreover, SOX9 binds to the SOX10 promoter and induces
  downregulation of SOX10 expression, revealing a feedback loop reinforcing the SOX10
  low/SOX9 high ant,m/ii-tumorigenic program. Finally, SOX9 is required in vitro and
  in vivo for the anti-tumorigenic effect achieved by reducing SOX10 expression. Thus,
  SOX10 and SOX9 are functionally antagonistic regulators of melanoma development.
