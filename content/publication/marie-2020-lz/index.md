abstract: Cutaneous malignant melanoma is an aggressive cancer of melanocytes with
  a strong propensity to metastasize. We posit that melanoma cells acquire metastatic
  capability by adopting an embryonic-like phenotype, and that a lineage approach
  would uncover metastatic melanoma biology. Using a genetically engineered mouse
  model to generate a rich melanoblast transcriptome dataset, we identify melanoblast-specific
  genes whose expression contribute to metastatic competence and derive a 43-gene
  signature that predicts patient survival. We identify a melanoblast gene, KDELR3,
  whose loss impairs experimental metastasis. In contrast, KDELR1 deficiency enhances
  metastasis, providing the first example of different disease etiologies within the
  KDELR-family of retrograde transporters. We show that KDELR3 regulates the metastasis
  suppressor, KAI1, and report an interaction with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase
  gp78, a regulator of KAI1 degradation. Our work demonstrates that the melanoblast
  transcriptome can be mined to uncover targetable pathways for melanoma therapy.
