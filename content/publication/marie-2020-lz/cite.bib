 abstract = {Cutaneous malignant melanoma is an aggressive cancer of
melanocytes with a strong propensity to metastasize. We posit
that melanoma cells acquire metastatic capability by adopting an
embryonic-like phenotype, and that a lineage approach would
uncover metastatic melanoma biology. Using a genetically
engineered mouse model to generate a rich melanoblast
transcriptome dataset, we identify melanoblast-specific genes
whose expression contribute to metastatic competence and derive a
43-gene signature that predicts patient survival. We identify a
melanoblast gene, KDELR3, whose loss impairs experimental
metastasis. In contrast, KDELR1 deficiency enhances metastasis,
providing the first example of different disease etiologies
within the KDELR-family of retrograde transporters. We show that
KDELR3 regulates the metastasis suppressor, KAI1, and report an
interaction with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase gp78, a
regulator of KAI1 degradation. Our work demonstrates that the
melanoblast transcriptome can be mined to uncover targetable
pathways for melanoma therapy.},
