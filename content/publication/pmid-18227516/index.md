abstract: Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) regulates transcription in response
  to stress and growth factor stimuli. Here, we use a mouse model in which ATF2 was
  selectively deleted in keratinocytes. Crossing the conditionally expressed ATF2
  mutant with K14-Cre mice (K14.ATF2(f/f)) resulted in selective expression of mutant
  ATF2 within the basal layer of the epidermis. When subjected to a two-stage skin
  carcinogenesis protocol [7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene/phorbol 12-tetradecanoate
  13-acetate (DMBA/TPA)], K14.ATF2(f/f) mice showed significant increases in both
  the incidence and prevalence of papilloma development compared with the WT ATF2
  mice. Consistent with these findings, keratinocytes of K14.ATF2(f/f) mice exhibit
  greater anchorage-independent growth compared with ATF2 WT keratinocytes. Papillomas
  of K14.ATF2(f/f) mice exhibit reduced expression of presenilin1, which is associated
  with enhanced beta-catenin and cyclin D1, and reduced Notch1 expression. Significantly,
  a reduction of nuclear ATF2 and increased beta-catenin expression were seen in samples
  of squamous and basal cell carcinoma, as opposed to normal skin. Our data reveal
  that loss of ATF2 transcriptional activity serves to promote skin tumor formation,
  thereby indicating a suppressor activity of ATF2 in skin tumor formation.
