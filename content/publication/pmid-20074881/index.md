abstract: In August 2007, four capsules containing white powders, said to have originated
  from an Israel-based Internet company \"Neorganics\", were anonymously delivered
  to the Royal Adelaide Hospital, South Australia. The capsules were analysed and
  the active components were identified including 4-methylmethcathinone, 2-fluoromethamphetamine,
  alpha-phthalimidopropiophenone and N-ethylcathinone, all of which were unlisted
  within South Australian controlled substance regulations. We examined the relevant
  scientific literature surrounding these chemicals and present both GCMS and NMR
  data for 4-methylmethcathinone and alpha-phthalimidopropiophenone, which have previously
  received little attention. We also present the vapour- and condensed-phase infrared
  spectra (IR) of 4-methylmethcathinone as these have also not been reported in the
  literature previously. We discuss the issues surrounding whether these chemicals
  can be classified as controlled substance analogues and the likely impact this could
  have on prosecutions of individuals distributing these products.
