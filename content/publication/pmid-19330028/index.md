abstract: A mutational analysis of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gene family
  in human melanoma identified somatic mutations in 23% of melanomas. Five mutations
  in one of the most commonly mutated genes, MMP8, reduced MMP enzyme activity. Expression
  of wild-type but not mutant MMP8 in human melanoma cells inhibited growth on soft
  agar in vitro and tumor formation in vivo, suggesting that wild-type MMP-8 has the
  ability to inhibit melanoma progression.
