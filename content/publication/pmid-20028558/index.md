abstract: Pulmonary metastasis continues to be the most common cause of death in osteosarcoma.
  Indeed, the 5-year survival for newly diagnosed osteosarcoma patients has not significantly
  changed in over 20 years. Further understanding of the mechanisms of metastasis
  and resistance for this aggressive pediatric cancer is necessary. Pet dogs naturally
  develop osteosarcoma providing a novel opportunity to model metastasis development
  and progression. Given the accelerated biology of canine osteosarcoma, we hypothesized
  that a direct comparison of canine and pediatric osteosarcoma expression profiles
  may help identify novel metastasis-associated tumor targets that have been missed
  through the study of the human cancer alone. Using parallel oligonucleotide array
  platforms, shared orthologues between species were identified and normalized. The
  osteosarcoma expression signatures could not distinguish the canine and human diseases
  by hierarchical clustering. Cross-species target mining identified two genes, interleukin-8
  (IL-8) and solute carrier family 1 (glial high affinity glutamate transporter),
  member 3 (SLC1A3), which were uniformly expressed in dog but not in all pediatric
  osteosarcoma patient samples. Expression of these genes in an independent population
  of pediatric osteosarcoma patients was associated with poor outcome (p = 0.020 and
  p = 0.026, respectively). Validation of IL-8 and SLC1A3 protein expression in pediatric
  osteosarcoma tissues further supported the potential value of these novel targets.
  Ongoing evaluation will validate the biological significance of these targets and
  their associated pathways. Collectively, these data support the strong similarities
  between human and canine osteosarcoma and underline the opportunities provided by
  a comparative oncology approach as a means to improve our understanding of cancer
  biology and therapies.
