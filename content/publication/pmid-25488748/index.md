abstract: Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most lethal human malignancies,
  but its genetic drivers remain little understood. In this study, we report losses
  in expression of the miRNA miR30a, which is downregulated in ATC compared with differentiated
  thyroid cancer and normal tissue. miR30a downregulation was associated with advanced
  differentiated thyroid cancer and higher mortality. Mechanistically, we found miR30a
  decreased cellular invasion and migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker
  levels, lysyl oxidase (LOX) expression, and metastatic capacity. LOX was identified
  as a direct target of miR30a that was overexpressed in ATC and associated with advanced
  differentiated thyroid cancer and higher mortality rate. Consistent with its role
  in other cancers, we found that LOX inhibited cell proliferation, cellular invasion,
  and migration and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Together, our findings establish
  a critical functional role for miR30a downregulation in mediating LOX upregulation
  and thyroid cancer progression, with implications for LOX targeting as a rational
  therapeutic strategy in ATC.
