abstract: Schizophrenia is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder whose genetic
  influences remain elusive. We hypothesize that individually rare structural variants
  contribute to the illness. Microdeletions and microduplications >100 kilobases were
  identified by microarray comparative genomic hybridization of genomic DNA from 150
  individuals with schizophrenia and 268 ancestry-matched controls. All variants were
  validated by high-resolution platforms. Novel deletions and duplications of genes
  were present in 5% of controls versus 15% of cases and 20% of young-onset cases,
  both highly significant differences. The association was independently replicated
  in patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia as compared with their parents. Mutations
  in cases disrupted genes disproportionately from signaling networks controlling
  neurodevelopment, including neuregulin and glutamate pathways. These results suggest
  that multiple, individually rare mutations altering genes in neurodevelopmental
  pathways contribute to schizophrenia.
