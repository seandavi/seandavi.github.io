abstract: Enhancers regulate spatiotemporal gene expression and impart cell-specific
  transcriptional outputs that drive cell identity. Super-enhancers (SEs), also known
  as stretch-enhancers, are a subset of enhancers especially important for genes associated
  with cell identity and genetic risk of disease. CD4(+) T cells are critical for
  host defence and autoimmunity. Here we analysed maps of mouse T-cell SEs as a non-biased
  means of identifying key regulatory nodes involved in cell specification. We found
  that cytokines and cytokine receptors were the dominant class of genes exhibiting
  SE architecture in T cells. Nonetheless, the locus encoding Bach2, a key negative
  regulator of effector differentiation, emerged as the most prominent T-cell SE,
  revealing a network in which SE-associated genes critical for T-cell biology are
  repressed by BACH2. Disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms for immune-mediated
  disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, were highly enriched for T-cell SEs versus
  typical enhancers or SEs in other cell lineages. Intriguingly, treatment of T cells
  with the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor tofacitinib disproportionately altered the
  expression of rheumatoid arthritis risk genes with SE structures. Together, these
  results indicate that genes with SE architecture in T cells encompass a variety
  of cytokines and cytokine receptors but are controlled by a 'guardian' transcription
  factor, itself endowed with an SE. Thus, enumeration of SEs allows the unbiased
  determination of key regulatory nodes in T cells, which are preferentially modulated
  by pharmacological intervention.
