abstract: Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites is an accurate method of identifying
  the location of genetic regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers,
  insulators, and locus control regions. We employed high-throughput sequencing and
  whole-genome tiled array strategies to identify DNase I HS sites within human primary
  CD4+ T cells. Combining these two technologies, we have created a comprehensive
  and accurate genome-wide open chromatin map. Surprisingly, only 16%-21% of the identified
  94,925 DNase I HS sites are found in promoters or first exons of known genes, but
  nearly half of the most open sites are in these regions. In conjunction with expression,
  motif, and chromatin immunoprecipitation data, we find evidence of cell-type-specific
  characteristics, including the ability to identify transcription start sites and
  locations of different chromatin marks utilized in these cells. In addition, and
  unexpectedly, our analyses have uncovered detailed features of nucleosome structure.
