abstract: Evidence for significant linkage in complexly inherited disorders usually
  necessitates independent, replicative studies. This study investigates the implications
  of including in the replicative studies families already used to suggest linkage
  in initial linkage analysis. We generated 1,000 unlinked replicates of 100 nuclear
  families with a complexly inherited disease but with no linkage to the markers analyzed.
  We then used a standard nonparametric linkage method to analyze these data. From
  the original 1,000 replicates of the original data set, one set was chosen as it
  yielded suggestive, but falsely positive, linkage results (LOD score = 3.4). Variable
  numbers of randomly selected families from this positive replicate (n = 100 families)
  were used to replace families in replicates of the original (unlinked) data set,
  and linkage analysis repeated. Overlap of families from the \"positive data set\"
  did increase the LOD scores for \"unlinked data sets.\" While a small amount of
  overlap (replacement) between a positive linkage result and the replication sample
  is unlikely in practice to alter results, our study suggests that steps should be
  taken to ensure that overlap is minimized. The implications of this overlapping
  recruitment on replicative linkage studies are discussed.
