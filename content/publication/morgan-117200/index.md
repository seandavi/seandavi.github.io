abstract: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (Grossman et al.
  2016, https://gdc.cancer.gov/) provides the cancer research community with an open
  and unified repository for sharing and accessing data across numerous cancer studies
  and projects via a high-performance data transfer and query infrastructure. The
  Bioconductor project (Huber et al. 2015) is an open source and open development
  software project built on the R statistical programming environment (R Core Team
  2016). A major goal of the Bioconductor project is to facilitate the use, analysis,
  and comprehension of genomic data. The GenomicDataCommons Bioconductor package provides
  basic infrastructure for querying, accessing, and mining genomic datasets available
  from the GDC. We expect that Bioconductor developer and bioinformatics community
  will build on the GenomicDataCommons package to add higher-level functionality and
  expose cancer genomics data to many state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods available
  in Bioconductor.Availability https://bioconductor.org/packages/GenomicDataCommons
