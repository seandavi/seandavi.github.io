abstract: 'We have evaluated 23 different statistics, from a total of 10 popular software
  packages for model-free linkage analysis of nuclear-family data, by applying them
  to single-marker data simulated under several two-locus disease models. The statistics
  that we examined fall into two broad categories: (1) those that test directly for
  increased identity-by-state or identity-by-descent sharing (by use of the programs
  APM, Genetic Analysis System [GAS] SIBSTATE and SIBDES, SAGE SIBPAL, ERPA, SimIBD,
  and Genehunter NPL) and (2) those that are based on likelihood-ratio tests and that
  report LOD scores (by use of the programs Splink, SIBPAIR, Mapmaker/Sibs, ASPEX,
  and GAS SIBMLS). For each of eight two-locus disease models, we analyzed six data
  sets; the first three data sets consisted of two-child families with both sibs affected
  and zero, one, or both parents typed, whereas the other three data sets consisted
  of four-child families with at least two affected sibs and zero, one, or both parents
  typed. We report false-positive rates, overall rank by power, and the power for
  each statistic. We give rough recommendations regarding which programs provide the
  most powerful tests for linkage, as well as the programs to be avoided under certain
  conditions. For the likelihood-ratio-based statistics, we examined the effects of
  various treatments of sibships with multiple affected individuals. Finally, we explored
  the use of some simple two-of-three composite statistics and found that such tests
  are of only marginal benefit over the most powerful single statistic.'
