abstract: "EWS-FLI1 is a chimeric ETS transcription factor that is, due to a chromosomal\
  \ rearrangement, specifically expressed in Ewing's sarcoma family tumors (ESFT)\
  \ and is thought to initiate the development of the disease. Previous genomic profiling\
  \ experiments have identified EWS-FLI1-regulated genes and genes that discriminate\
  \ ESFT from other sarcomas, but so far a comprehensive analysis of EWS-FLI1-dependent\
  \ molecular functions characterizing this aggressive cancer is lacking. In this\
  \ study, a molecular function map of ESFT was constructed based on an integrative\
  \ analysis of gene expression profiling experiments following EWS-FLI1 knockdown\
  \ in a panel of five ESFT cell lines, and on gene expression data from the same\
  \ platform of 59 primary ESFT. Out of 80 normal tissues tested, mesenchymal progenitor\
  \ cells (MPC) were found to fit the hypothesis that EWS-FLI1 is the driving transcriptional\
  \ force in ESFT best and were therefore used as the reference tissue for the construction\
  \ of the molecular function map. The interrelations of molecular pathways were visualized\
  \ by measuring the similarity among annotated gene functions by gene sharing. The\
  \ molecular function map highlighted distinct clusters of activities for EWS-FLI1\
  \ regulated genes in ESFT and revealed a striking difference between EWS-FLI1 up-\
  \ and down-regulated genes: EWS-FLI1 induced genes mainly belong to cell cycle regulation,\
  \ proliferation, and response to DNA damage, while repressed genes were associated\
  \ with differentiation and cell communication. This study revealed that EWS-FLI1\
  \ combines by distinct molecular mechanisms two important functions of cellular\
  \ transformation in one protein, growth promotion and differentiation blockage.\
  \ By taking MPC as a reference tissue, a significant EWS-FLI1 signature was discovered\
  \ in ESFT that only partially overlapped with previously published EWS-FLI1-dependent\
  \ gene expression patterns, identifying a series of novel targets for the chimeric\
  \ protein in ESFT. Our results may guide target selection for future ESFT specific\
  \ therapies."
