abstract: We broadly profiled DNA methylation in breast cancers (n = 351) and benign
  parenchyma (n = 47) for correspondence with disease phenotype, using FFPE diagnostic
  surgical pathology specimens. Exploratory analysis revealed a distinctive primary
  invasive carcinoma subclass featuring extreme global methylation deviation. Subsequently,
  we tested the correlation between methylation remodeling pervasiveness and malignant
  biological features. A methyl deviation index (MDI) was calculated for each lesion
  relative to terminal ductal-lobular unit baseline, and group comparisons revealed
  that high-grade and short-survival estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)) cancers manifest
  a significantly higher MDI than low-grade and long-survival ER(+) cancers. In contrast,
  ER(-) cancers display a significantly lower MDI, revealing a striking epigenomic
  distinction between cancer hormone receptor subtypes. Kaplan-Meier survival curves
  of MDI-based risk classes showed significant divergence between low- and high-risk
  groups. MDI showed superior prognostic performance to crude methylation levels,
  and MDI retained prognostic significance (P < 0.01) in Cox multivariate analysis,
  including clinical stage and pathological grade. Most MDI targets individually are
  significant markers of ER(+) cancer survival. Lymphoid and mesenchymal indexes were
  not substantially different between ER(+) and ER(-) groups and do not explain MDI
  dichotomy. However, the mesenchymal index was associated with ER(+) cancer survival,
  and a high lymphoid index was associated with medullary carcinoma. Finally, a comparison
  between metastases and primary tumors suggests methylation patterns are established
  early and maintained through disease progression for both ER(+) and ER(-) tumors.
