abstract: Ewing's sarcoma is characterized by the presence of fusion oncoproteins
  involving EWSR1 and an ETS gene, most commonly FLI1. In this issue of Cancer Cell,
  Smith et al. have combined RNA interference with expression profiling to study the
  pattern of gene expression downstream of the most common of these fusions, EWS/FLI.
  Using this strategy, Smith et al. have identified a homeobox gene, NKX2.2, which
  is both highly expressed in Ewing's sarcoma and essential for the transforming activity
  of EWS/FLI.
