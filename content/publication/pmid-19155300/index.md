abstract: Emerging technologies allow broad profiling of the cancer genome for differential
  DNA methylation relative to benign cells. Herein, bisulfite-modified DNA from lymph
  nodes with either reactive hyperplasia or follicular lymphoma (FL) were analyzed
  using a commercial C/UpG genotyping assay. Two hundred fifty-nine differentially
  methylated targets (DMT) distributed among 183 unique genes were identified in FL.
  Comparison of matched formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and frozen surgical pathology
  replicates showed the complete preservation of the cancer methylome among differently
  archived tissue specimens. Analysis of the DMT profile is consistent with a pervasive
  epigenomic remodeling process in FL that affects predominantly nonlymphoid genes.
