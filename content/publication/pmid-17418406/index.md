abstract: Synovial sarcoma is characterized by the presence of a fusion protein involving
  SYT and SSX2. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Haldar et al. have genetically engineered
  a mouse model of this disease. They show that expression of the SYT-SSX2 fusion
  gene yields a highly penetrant and representative model of human synovial sarcoma,
  but only if expression occurs in a particular biologic context. The mouse model
  will be a valuable resource for studying tumor biology but is also a striking example
  of how important understanding of normal tissue and developmental biology is to
  our understanding of cancer.
