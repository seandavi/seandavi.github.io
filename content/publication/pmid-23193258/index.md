abstract: The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) is an
  international public repository for high-throughput microarray and next-generation
  sequence functional genomic data sets submitted by the research community. The resource
  supports archiving of raw data, processed data and metadata which are indexed, cross-linked
  and searchable. All data are freely available for download in a variety of formats.
  GEO also provides several web-based tools and strategies to assist users to query,
  analyse and visualize data. This article reports current status and recent database
  developments, including the release of GEO2R, an R-based web application that helps
  users analyse GEO data.
