abstract: Constitutively activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations of
  the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3) play an important
  role in leukaemogenesis. We have examined, by cDNA microarray analysis, the changes
  in gene expression induced by FLT3/ITD or constitutively activated wild type FLT3
  signalling. A limited set of genes was consistently affected by FLT3 inhibition.
  In confirmation of their FLT3 dependence, these genes returned toward pretreatment
  levels of expression after reversal of FLT3 inhibition. Several of the most significantly
  affected genes are involved in the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase, Janus kinase/signal
  transducer and activator of transcription and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT
  pathways. These data suggest that constitutively activated FLT3 works through multiple
  signal transduction pathways. PIM1, MYC and CCND3 were chosen from this gene set
  to explore their biological roles. Knock-down of these genes by small interfering
  RNA showed that these genes play important roles in constitutively activated FLT3
  expressing cells. The alterations of the gene expression profiles in these cells
  help to further elucidate the mechanisms of FLT3-mediated leukaemogenesis.
